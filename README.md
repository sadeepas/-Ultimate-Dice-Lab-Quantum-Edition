# 🎲 Ultimate Dice Lab — Quantum Edition

A feature-complete, visually engaging dice roll simulator and probability analysis tool built with modern web technologies. This application provides a comprehensive platform for single rolls, large-scale simulations, and statistical analysis, all wrapped in a sleek, customizable, and quantum-themed user interface.

## 📜 Description

The **Ultimate Dice Lab — Quantum Edition** is more than just a simple dice roller. It's a powerful tool for exploring probability distributions and statistics. Whether you're a tabletop gamer, a student of probability, or a developer, this application offers a rich set of features to meet your needs. You can roll various types of dice, run massive simulations to observe the law of large numbers in action, and even test your luck in a "Casino Mode." The application also provides in-depth statistical analysis, including a Chi-Squared test for fairness, and allows you to export your data for further analysis.

## ✨ Features

*   **Customizable Dice Rolls**: Choose from a variety of dice types (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) and roll up to five dice at once.
*   **Multiple Themes**: Personalize your experience with different dice themes, including Classic, Neon, and Metallic.
*   **Advanced Simulations**: Run large-scale simulations with thousands of trials to generate robust statistical data.
*   **In-Depth Statistics**: Get real-time updates on key metrics like the total number of trials, mean, and mode of the sums.
*   **Frequency Distribution**: Visualize the results of your rolls with an interactive bar chart that compares experimental outcomes against theoretical probabilities.
*   **Casino Mode**: Test your luck by betting on the sum of the dice, or whether the outcome is odd, even, high, or low.
*   **Data Portability**:
    *   Download your frequency data as a CSV file.
    *   Export the entire application state as a JSON file to save your session.
    *   Import a previously saved JSON file to restore your session.
*   **Fairness Testing**: A built-in Chi-Squared test helps you determine if the dice rolls are statistically fair.
*   **Leaderboard**: Save your casino mode balance to a local leaderboard and compete for the top spot.
*   **Sound Effects**: Optional sound effects for an immersive experience.
*   **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes to suit your preference.
